EthForAll hackathon project to implement the web3 version of Splitwise. This dApp uses a smart contract in order to record each transaction. Settlement transactions can then take place to reconcile everyone's debt. Furthremore, the contract balance can be used as a form of shared bank account where people may over-pay on their debts and others can take interest-free withdrawls from it.
